CX-TEXT-TEMPLATES Project

This project is designed to store and manage frequently used office messages efficiently. The goal is to eliminate the need for manual copying, pasting, and selecting text, which consumes too much time during daily tasks. By implementing a centralized, user-friendly system, we can significantly improve workflow speed and accuracy.
